              XbotiX 2023 is the robotic competition organized by Electrical and
              Information Engineering Society (EIES) in collaboration with IEEE
              Student Branch, IET Ruhuna Chapter and Mechanical and Manufacturing
              Engineering Student Society (MMESS) university of Ruhuna are excited
              to announce the event ‘XbotiX-2023’ which will be held at the
              premises of Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna. This is an
              event in which the best young minds in the country are competing
              head to head to accomplish a unique goal using self-designed robots.
              Both undergraduates and school level students are invited to compete
              through separate categories. Teams are challenged to design, build
              and program robots to perform a specified task under competition
              rules and time limits.
